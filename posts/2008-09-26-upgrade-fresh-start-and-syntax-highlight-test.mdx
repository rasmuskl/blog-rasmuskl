I've upgraded my blog to BlogEngine 1.4.5 and deleted the few old posts I had. They weren't very interesting anyways.

I've decided to use [syntaxhighlighter](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) for code snippets, so this post will serve as a small test of this too.

```csharp
public void HelloWorld()
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

Hope it works out right.
