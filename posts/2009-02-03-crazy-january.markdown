What a great start on 2009, I only hope the rest of the year will be as eventful as this month. The highlights were:
 
 - Blogger of the month on danish MSDN Flash [newsletter](http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/msdn/nyhedsbreve/2009/januar2009.htm) [danish].
 - Awarded the [MDIP](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielmf/archive/2008/04/23/mdip-microsoft-designated-information-provider.aspx) (Microsoft Designated Information Provider) title [danish] by [Daniel](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielmf/).
 - Was invited to join the core group of [Aarhus .NET User Group](htttp://www.anug.dk) [danish].

I am truly humbled by all these things, it's just great to know that someone out there thinks that my ramblings and crazy technical obsession is valuable.
 
Anyway, back to the technical posts.
