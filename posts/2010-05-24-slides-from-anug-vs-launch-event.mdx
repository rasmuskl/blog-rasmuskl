I spoke last week about ReSharper 5 at [ANUG](http://www.anug.dk)'s Visual Studio 2010 launch event. 
  
Here are the slides from my presentation. The slides are in danish and probably won't make too much sense as most of my presentation was done demoing stuff - but they should give the gist of it.

If you have any questions on my presentation, feel free to shoot me a mail here on the blog :-)
