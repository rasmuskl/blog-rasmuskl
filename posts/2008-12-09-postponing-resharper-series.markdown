I haven't written much lately, mostly because I was planning a series on ReSharper, which would be an event that ran for X days - with 1 post each day. I'm still going to do this, but my current workload doesn't allow me to work up enough posts to have a consistent buffer (plus I want to write it as I go) - so I'm postponing it officially - so I can feel alright about posting other stuff. :-)
