I have been using black background in Visual Studio for as long I can remember. I started out using Rob Coneryâ€™s black / orange TextMate theme, but last year I created my own black theme with a blueish style. Today at the [ANUG](http://www.anug.dk) code dojo we tweaked it to actually look alright with the changes in Visual Studio and especially ReSharper.
  
You can download the theme [here](/files/RKL-blue-theme-vs2010-2010-04-20.zip) if you want a nice black theme.
  
It looks like this:

Enjoy :-)
