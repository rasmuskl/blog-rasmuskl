I gave my Exploring C# DSLs: LINQ, Fluent Interfaces and Expression Trees talk today at [Miracle Open World 2012](http://mow2012.dk) about C# Domain Specific Languages.

The slides are now available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/rasmuskl/exploring-c-dsls-linq).

... and the demo source is available as a git repository on bitbucket [here](http://bitbucket.org/rasmuskl/mow2012dsltalk/).

Note that some of the source is just mocked implementation, the goal was not really to show production level quality - but rather concepts. The quality of the few tests and commit messages reflect this.
