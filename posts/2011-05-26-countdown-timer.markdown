I demoed a small app today at the Demo Dag session at Community Day.
  
The app was developed at an ANUG Code Dojo - and the purpose is simply to create timers that are a few pixels high either at the bottom or top of your screen - to be used for running Pomodoros or other timing needs - like an informal timer for a presentation.
  
I got a few requests for the app, so I've uploaded the source to Bitbucket [here](http://bitbucket.org/rasmuskl/countdown/downloads) (there's also a v. 0.1 zip file with an executable - if you don't want to build from source).
  
Bear in mind that this app was hacked together in a few hours (with the purpose of learning WPF actually - we got sidetracked) - so don't expect quality code or an excellent polished app. It has quirks - you have been warned :-)

Enjoy.
