After going through the pain of (re-)discovering how to convert a Mercurial repository into a Git repository on Windows, I thought I'd share how easy it really is. I've bounced back and forth between Mercurial and Git a few times - my current preference is Git, mainly because I like Git's branching strategy a bit better - but really, they're both excellent choices. I still find the best analogy for comparing them is that [Git is MacGyver and Mercurial is James Bond](http://importantshock.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/git-vs-mercurial/).
  
You can find quite a few [posts](http://arr.gr/blog/2011/10/bitbucket-converting-hg-repositories-to-git/) [describing](http://candidcode.com/2010/01/12/a-guide-to-converting-from-mercurial-hg-to-git-on-a-windows-client/) how to convert - but many of the steps mentioned in those guides are not needed if you have [TortoiseHg](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/) installed, which most Windows Mercurial users do.
  
## Prerequisites
  
As I already mentioned, this guide expects that you have [TortoiseHg](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/) installed on your system. 
  
For the actual conversion, we're going to be using a Mercurial extension called [hggit](https://github.com/schacon/hg-git) that enables Mercurial to push and pull from Git repositories. You can either clone the [hggit](https://github.com/schacon/hg-git) repository on GitHub or grab a zipped version [here](https://github.com/schacon/hg-git/downloads).
  
What we need is the **hggit** folder from the clone or zip file - put this some place handy and remember the path.
  
## Preparing the Git repository
  
In this guide we're going to be pushing our repository to a local Git repository - so let's create a bare repository - this way you'll avoid Git complains about [pushing to a non-bare repository](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/01/push-to-only-bare-repositories.html).
  
Open a command prompt, create a directory for the new repository and from within the directory execute: `git init -bare`
  
That's it - our Git repository is ready. Alternatively you could push directly to a Git repository on either [GitHub](http://www.github.com), [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) or other provider.
  
## Enabling hggit in Mercurial
  
Now we need to let Mercurial know about the hggit extension. This is done by adding it to the **.hgrc** or **mercurial.ini** file in your home directory (for me that'd be **c:\users\rasmuskl\mercurial.ini**). 
  
In the config file, find the **[extensions]** section - or add it at bottom if it's not already there. Then add a reference to the hggit extension followed by the path of the hggit folder:

```  
hggit = c:\path\to\hggit
``` 

## Converting the repository
  
To convert the repository, simply open your command prompt, navigate to your Mercurial repository and do: `hg push c:\path\to\bare\git\repository`
  
And you're done. You can now either clone the bare repository to a working directory - or push it to your GitHub or Bitbucket account.
