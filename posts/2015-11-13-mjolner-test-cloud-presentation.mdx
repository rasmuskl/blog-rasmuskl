Mjølner was kind enough to invite Karl Krukow and me along with our evangelist Mike James to come and talk at their Xamarin seminar.

They have posted a blog post about the event [here](http://mjolner.dk/events/xamarin-videos-how-to-build-and-test-apps-with-xamarin/).

The talk that me and Karl did was a rehash of our [Evolve 2014 talk](/2015/06/18/xamarin-evolve-presentation/) from last year.

The presentation was recorded and is available on YouTube:
