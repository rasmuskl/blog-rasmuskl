I've decided to release my ReSharper course material under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

The material can be found at on [GitHub](http://github.com/rasmuskl/ReSharperCourse).

A short description of the course can be found in the git repository README (pasted below).

The precompiled exercises-PDF can be downloaded [here on GitHub](https://github.com/rasmuskl/ReSharperCourse/raw/master/Source/ReSharper%20Exercises.pdf).

# Introduction

This is my basic [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) course material developed in 2012 - based on ReSharper 6.1, although a lot of the material is still relevant. 

It should provide enough content for 4 to 6 hours of entertainment. The course focuses on progressivly harder exercises and hands-on experience over a lot of talk.

Exercises are generated through the ASP.NET MVC site found in `Source/CourseTasks`.

# Topics
