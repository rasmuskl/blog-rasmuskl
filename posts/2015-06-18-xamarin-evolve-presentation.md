As part of my work for Xamarin, I was lucky enough to get the chance to present at the main stage at Xamarin Evolve last year with Karl Krukow.

Our talk was about mobile testing with [Xamarin Test Cloud](http://xamarin.com/test-cloud) and my part specifically was about the test framework I have been working on: [Xamarin.UITest](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/)

The presentation is available on YouTube - my part starts at around 21:30. Also there is our neat demo with live streaming from one of the actual Test Cloud labs at around 57:00.
